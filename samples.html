           Business Context. For this case, students are working as a data analytics consultant for The Walt Disney Studios,
           one of the "Big Five" major film studios located in Burbank, CA. The team recruiting has manually kept track of
           metrics and attributes associated with each film produced from 1937 to 2016. As their new data scientist, students
           have been tasked with the question: "Which films have been the most lucrative for our studios and how can we use
           their success as a signal for driving sales forward?"
