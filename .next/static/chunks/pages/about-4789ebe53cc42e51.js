I earned my B.S. in Cognitive and Brain Sciences in 2021 and was accepted with an early assurance to the Graduate School of Engineering during my junior year of undergrad. Over the years, I've held a number of internships, fellowships, and research assistantships at a number of places including Tufts School of Medicine, IBM Research, Google Research, Harvard, MIT, and Prudential. Most recently, I graduated with honors from the Correlation One DS4A Fellows program and earned the Presidential Award for Civic Life from my alma mater, the university's highest award conferred to only a handful of students. I also cofounded my school's first org for Black students in CS, was president of the Black Student Union, an Africana Peer Leader, served on the board of a college, and was part of the university's DEI Taskforce in Psychology. As a member, I worked to bring back Black Psychology to the major and earn fee waivers for BIPOC PhD applicants.
