There are hundreds of Next.js blog starters out there. I've tinkered with a few dozen of them, and while there are many that are quite good, they just didn't seem to fit what I wanted to do with them. Nothing was ready out of the box. That's fine for some projects, but for others, I'm not looking to reinvent the wheel. 

# Morning Routine

Every morning I wake up around 7 AM to prepare for my commute to campus.
